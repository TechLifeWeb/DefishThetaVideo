# DefishThetaVideo

This batch file loops through all the MP4 Theta S videos you have put into a specific Windows folder and converts each from dual fish eye to a 360 video.

This batch file requires you first install the Richo Theta tools for Windows. Download that software from here: https://theta360.com/en/support/download/
Additionally, You MUST update the paths that are used on your system. You'll see notes on these changes within the batch file itself.
